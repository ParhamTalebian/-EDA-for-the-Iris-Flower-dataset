# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for the Iris Flower Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris Flower dataset. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for educational and illustrative purposes.

## Dataset Information
- **Dataset:** Iris Flower dataset
- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)
- **Description:** The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each belonging to one of three species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica. There are four features measured for each sample: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Contents
- `EDA_Iris_Flower_Dataset.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code and analysis for the EDA.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the EDA.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The EDA includes the following analyses:
- **Univariate Analysis:** Histograms and descriptive statistics for each feature.
- **Bivariate Analysis:** Pair plots, correlation matrix, and scatter plots for exploring relationships between features.
- **Multivariate Analysis:** 3D scatter plots for a more comprehensive view.

## How to Use
1. Open the `EDA_Iris_Flower_Dataset.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. Run each cell sequentially to execute the code and visualize the analysis.

## Dependencies
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
